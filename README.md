## Getting Started

## Installation

## How to commit

Instead use the classic command ```git add . & git commit -m "<message>"``` you have to use:

```
yarn cm

or

npm run cm
```

This is because we have a pre configured commit style.

## Running your React Native application
### Step 1: Start Metro
First, you will need to start Metro, the JavaScript bundler that ships with React Native.

```bash
npx react-native start
```

### Step 2: Start your application
Let Metro Bundler run in its own terminal. Open a new terminal inside your React Native project folder. Run the following:

```bash
npx react-native run-ios

or

npx react-native run-android
```
